# BMI_challenge

A program that calculates BMI (body mass index) in imperial and metric unit systems.

### Synopsis

We created a front and back end site that uses Javascript, HTML, CSS and jQuery.  
We used jasmine as a testing tool to see that everything works as it should.

### Motivation

Our motivation for this project was to sharpen our skills in Javascript, HTML, CSS, jQuery and combine them all together. To also learn the bootstrap framework.

## Getting Started

Load the index webpage and select your preferred unit system.
Enter your height and weight values and click calculate.
